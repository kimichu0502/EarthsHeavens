          crater, this otherworldly landscape looks straight out of a sci-fi movie. The vibrant reds, yellows, greens
          and blues that characterise Dallol are formed as water is heated by underlying magma and pushed up through the
          volcanic rock, reacting with minerals in the ground.</p>

        <p class="mountDes">The Komodo National Park encompasses a total of 29 volcanic islands (including the 3 major
          islands Rinca, Padar and Komodo) and is home to approximately 2,500 Komodo Dragons and other terrestrial fauna
          such as various species of reptiles, birds, and mammals. The park’s terrain is uniquely diverse, consisting of
          a mountainous hillside, tropical rain forests, grass-woodland savannah, and pristine white sandy beaches that
          harbor rich marine biodiversity. The marine environment in the Komodo National Park is one of the world’s
          richest in flora and fauna and is still relatively undiscovered. </p>

        <p class="mountDes">Canada is a country practically made for nature lovers. If you have the time, the best way
          to see this country is to travel from coast to coast in a rental camper. If time isn’t on your side, consider
          making your way to Alberta. This Provence is full of epic landscapes and some of the most incredible natural
          discoveries. One such discovery is the frozen methane bubbles that become trapped underneath Lake Abraham. As
          the lake freezes over for winter, the bubbles are trapped underneath.</p>

        <p class="mountDes">The Colorado River started to cut through endless layers of rock, and when it ran into
          Horseshoe Bend, it creates this natural, sculptural landscape. The river eventually went around it, and now
          there is a 270-degree bend in the river which created the now-famous horseshoe shape.</p>
